    <h2>
        Electronic Records
    </h2>
    <p>
        After the office has notified you that surgery has been scheduled, you 
        can request a copy of the preoperative orders by e-mail. Preoperative 
        orders are needed to obtain preoperative studies such as laboratories, 
        chest x-rays, and EKG's that may be needed prior to surgery. The orders 
        are faxed by my office to the facility where surgery is to take place. 
        Unfortunately, fax machines are less than perfect. I recommend that you 
        request the orders and take them with you for your preoperative 
        appointment with the hospital/surgical facility.
