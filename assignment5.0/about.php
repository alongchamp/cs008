        After graduating with a degree in biochemistry from The Pennsylvania 
        State University, I returned to New England for my medical training. I 
        earned my “M.D.” in the same hospital where  I was born in Burlington, 
        VT.  The University of Vermont College of Medicine granted my degree 
        with a major in surgery in 1994.

        My internship, residency, and chief resident training was then completed
        over a half-decade in New Haven, CT at the Hospital of Saint Raphael. 
        This Yale affiliated program provided a wide spectrum of experience in 
        surgical care: general , vascular, cardiothoracic, critical care, 
        trauma, and pediatric surgery services.

        I have been practicing general surgery  in Ventura County since 1999. In
        this time, I have performed thousands of procedures. Furthermore, I 
        participate as a surgeon leader; I have been a  member of the  peer 
        review committee, vice chief, and chief of surgery at The Los Robles 
        Hospital and Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.
