        Operating on a patient is a privilege, not a right granted by a medical degree.
    </h1>
    <p>
        Successful surgery is not only the result of what happens in the 
        operating room. Instead, it is a combination of preparation before, 
        expertise during, and attention to detail after an operation. The 
        surgeon must fully evaluate the patient prior to operating. This ensures
        proper choice of procedure as well as ensuring the patient can tolerate 
        the surgery. During the procedure, expertise and experience matters; a 
        surgeon must possess the knowledge and experience to make subtle changes
        in technique as dictated by differences in anatomy and intraoperative 
        findings.  Lastly, appropriate care for the patient after a procedure is
        the job of the surgeon who performed the surgery. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As a surgeon that believes that operating on a patient is a privilege, I
        personally take part in care before, during, and after surgery. At the 
        first meeting or consultation I will evaluate the current problem as 
        well as the past medical history of the patient. During the procedure, 
        my experience and expertise over the past fifteen years counts. Lastly, 
        after the surgery, it is I who will be monitoring the patientâ€™s progress
        towards returned health. Every patient should expect this level of care.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have built a successful  practice in Ventura County over the past 
        fifteen years as a board certified general surgeon. I truly enjoy my 
        chosen field.  Please explore this web site. If my expertise suits your 
        needs, please call and make an appointment. As I have already stated, it
        will be my privilege!
