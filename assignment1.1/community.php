        </h2>
        <p>
            Community service in the form of collecting trash and recyclables 
            from the side of roads and other places can also help with cleaning 
            up the pollution of Earth.  By going out and picking up trash for a 
            little while every weekend or even every month can help bring down 
            the rate of pollution and trash around. By doing this you can help 
            to decrease the amount of animals killed by swallowing a piece of 
            plastic or even get choked by it. It can also help with making the 
            land healthier because there wonâ€™t be the toxins in the ground as 
            well as making it look better without trash being everywhere.
