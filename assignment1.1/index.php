            This planet that we call Earth just keeps getting hurt more and more as human kind keeps growing. As the human population increases we become more wasteful because of our consumption. On average, Americans alone, use 50 billion water bottles and according to the website https://www.banthebottle.net/bottled-water-facts/ out of every 167 water bottles used only about 38 were recycled. Since all of these bottles of water are wasted just buying half as many bottles of water or even just buying a water purification bottle can reduce the size of our landfills around the US and the world as well as preserving resources that are being wasted from the bottles.
