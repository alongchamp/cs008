        The point of this site is to tell more people about my favorite game 
        series: Monster Hunter. In 2004 Capcom made their first release in this 
        great series. At first the game was only on Playstation 2 but as time 
        progressed it moved to the Playstation Portable and then is now 
        currently housed on the 3ds where it will most likely stay. Since Capcom
        is highly based in Japan there arenâ€™t as many games that have been 
        released here as there are in Japan. The games offer hours of intense 
        gameplay with stunning (for the systems) environment and so much more. 
        You have to experience it to truly understand how wonderful this game 
        is. To help us gather data from people who access this site and to get

    <h2>
        Premise of the Game
    </h2>
    <p>
        This game is based in another world where monster roam and terrorize 
        town in certain times. Your job is to hunt these monsters to stop their 
        attacks and save the town. As you progress in the game you hunt monsters
        that are harder and harder to prove that you are the top hunter. Along 
        with thrilling gameplay there are beautiful landscapes that not even the
        machines themselves are able to show due to hardware capabilities but 
        you will know how wonderful they are when you play for yourself.
