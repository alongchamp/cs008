        I was walking around Burlington, VT one day and wondered if I could 
        actually get up to the top of the Hilton hotel to take photos. After 
        walking up to the 7th floor (which was the top floor accessible by 
        patrons) I found the only window that could look over the water and 
        found this for a view. I thought that it was a great composition because
        of how the reflection really captures the light and how it reflects off 
        the water and the sun flare. The image is a little messed up due to the 
        fact it was shot through a window and there were a lot of spider webs on
        the window but they give it a sort of unique look.
