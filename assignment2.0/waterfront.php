        These photos in the GIF are all ones that I took while I was walking 
        along the waterfront in Burlington, VT at sunset. I was looking out over
        the water while walking and the light along the water and over the 
        mountains and thought that they all played well together. On one of the 
        shots I was able to get a natural lens flare which brought the picture 
        to a whole new light. In another with the boats I was trying to capture 
        the docks at sunset and it was pretty well captured. With the light 
        coming off of the lake it reflected on the boats well and it also 
        created a nice shadow in the background of the photo.
