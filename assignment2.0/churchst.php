        While walking down Church Street in Burlington, VT I saw this sign and 
        thought that it might make a good picture with the background (even 
        though I had to get rid of it when making the file a .png file to fill 
        the requirement). The composition is a focus on the lighting that is on 
        the sign and how crisp the lines are on the sign. Compared to my other 
        photos taken with this camera, this is one of my most favorites. This 
        photo has many colors and has a great focal point with great prominence 
        on the actual sign.
